Project Overview:

Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop a car rental Web application, that is user-friendly, efficient, and reliable. This web application has as objective to simplify the process of renting vehicles for various type of users, such as the customer looking to rent a car, the customer service representatives managing rental processes, and system administrators overseeing the platform's operations.
These are some key objectives:
User experience: Creating an interface that will allow the customers to easily browse, reserve, and manage their rentals.
Simplify operations: Automate the car rental process, to make it easier and efficient for customer service representative and system administrator (CRUD for reservations). 
Up to date vehicle management: Implement vehicle management capabilities to allow updates to the availability of the rental cars (CRUD for vehicles).
Strong user management: Implement secure user management system that supports different roles enabling different permissions (CRUD for user accounts).
Scalability and Reliability: Ensure the amount of growing user and inventory the web application could handle to ensure high performance and reliability.
Reviews: Integrate possibility of feedback and rating for the rental cars by customer.
Check-out process: Implement efficient checking-out process with assured inspection of vehicle, review of rental agreement and payment which is reserved as a function for the customer service representative.

Scope

The scope of Sprint 1 is about establishing the project's foundational elements. This includes setting up the GitHub repository and detailing the project's structure within the README file. The README will offer an overview of the project, outlining the core features, the project objectives, and the proposed implementation strategy. Key tasks involve deciding on the framework and programming languages that will be used for development. Organizing tasks and assigning roles to each team member. This organization extends to maintaining a log of activities, tracking the time spent on each task, and formulating a plan for sprint 2. 
The core functionalities considered include:
Browse vehicles: Customers can view available vehicles that can be filtered by type location and availability. 
Reservation: The customers must be able to make, modify and cancel reservations.
User account management: The users can register, log in, manage their profiles, and view their rental car history.
Different user permissions: The administrators and CSR must be able to manage vehicle listing and user accounts.

Target Audience

The web application targets three different type of users: customers, CSR and administrators.
Customers: These users are seeking to rent a vehicle. They need an efficient, easy to use platform to browse through vehicles, reserve and manage their rental history.
Customer Service Representatives: These users must assist the customers with reservations, check-in, and check-out. They need different permissions to manage reservation, interact with customer, and the availability of vehicles.
System Administrators: These users maintain the web application. They have the most rights. They manage the vehicle listing, the user accounts, and the settings.

Project Approach

Development Methodology

This project will be using the Agile development methodology. This aligns with the dynamic nature of this project and the need for rapid prototyping. Agile is good because of its adaptability, iterative methodology, and focus on customer feedback and collaboration. These factors that are essential for creating a user-centered rental vehicle application. With this strategy, the team can respond to changes fasts, deliver prototypes through sprints presented to the SCRUM master which will allow us to continuously improve the web application based on the feedback.

Project Timeline

This project is structured into 4 sprints over a 10-week period. Each sprint is about 2 and a half weeks. This is an overview of the timeline:

Weeks 1-2: Sprint 1 focuses on project setup, defining core functionalities, and initial development tasks such as setting up the development environment and discussing basic application structure.
Weeks 3-5: Sprint 2 is dedicated to developing key features identified in Sprint 1, with a focus on implementing user stories related to vehicle browsing and reservation functionalities.
Weeks 6-8: Sprint 3 will build upon the work from the previous sprints, adding more complex features such as user account management and advanced vehicle filtering options.
Weeks 9-10: Sprint 4 will finalize the prototype with a focus on refining features, conducting user testing, and addressing any remaining issues or feedback.

Collaboration and Communication

The team uses different tools and practices to collaborate and communicate.

GitHub: This will be used as the central collaboration method. On this platform, the team will manage the code, will track user issues, and document. The project repository will be held here, manage pull requests and track progress with a Minutes file which includes detailed log of each team member and wiki pages that will serve as planning for next Sprints.
Discord: This will be used as the main communication platform. Where we communicate daily about quick updates and informal discussions.
In-Person meetings: These will be scheduled during the team’s mutual school breaks. This will facilitate discussion, brainstorming and collaborative work.
Meeting Minutes: There will be a minute file on GitHub, that will document each meeting and log of each member’s activity.
